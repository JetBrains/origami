This is mostly an extracted, hardly reorganized and slightly modified source of [`elm-voronoi` package by @garrickb](https://github.com/garrickb/elm-voronoi),
adapted to be used as a module, and now lacking everything related to rendering to HTML/SVG.

Since it is not a distibuted package, we had to do this.
